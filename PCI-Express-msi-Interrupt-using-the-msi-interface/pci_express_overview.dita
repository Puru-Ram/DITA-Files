                <li>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a connection interface standard.</li>
                <li>The PCI Express is an upgrade over the previous PCI, where it offers more
                    bandwidth and is compatible with existing operating systems. </li>
                <li>Unlike the PCIâ€™s parallel connection, the PCI handles several point-to-point
                    serial connections with a switch (like a network).</li>
